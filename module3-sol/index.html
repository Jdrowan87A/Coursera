		<h3>Chicken</h3>
		<p>This is where the chicken text would normally go. I, however, cannot talk about chicken 
		for however many lines this is going take. Or can I? I feel if I tried to do so, I may offend some people, as chickens are among the worst treated animals (at least in the US) and supporting such abusive treatments of animals with the purchase of chicken can be seen as an issue. There are those on the other side that do not know, are willfully ignorant or just don't care. There are most definitely locations in the US that ethically raise chickens for human consumption. To change gears I will move as far away from chickens and move to the AMD ryzen CPU line. I have had great experience with them and would like to buy a new laptop with the 4000 line APU, but for some reason the best ones are not being sold. I do not know why. I refer to the Ryzen 7 4800u. 8 cores 16 threads and 8 on-chip processing units. It will not come close to a dedicated graphics chipset or graphics card, but holds it own for graphics. Fun story: I have the 2500u(4C-8T) and wondered if WOW would play on it. It did. Very well. And I lost my summer to that game. Back tracking, the 4800u is in no American laptop at the moment, only the 4700u (8C8T) with a benchmark rating of about 70% of the 4800u. Most would say "close enough", but I'd rather drop my money on the 4800u. Recently ,though, I have found that the Intel chips are better with memory than AMD, even though AMD benchmarks are better elsewhere. Also, the reason I want an APU and not a CPU and graphics set is because they are low power and usually can be recharged by USB-C cable and power banks. This means that my 2 lb power bank can charge my phone 5 times or my laptop once. 3 small power banks would give me a full day of working on my laptop using a hotspot pretty much anywhere. Working by the lake sounds really nice, to be honest. Ok, I think that is enough text.</p>
